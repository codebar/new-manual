            Your sponsorship will enable more women, LGBTQ and people from under-represented minority groups to get started in development, or raise their skills to the next level. You will also have contact with developers of all levels at our workshops. Many of codebarâ€™s students have found jobs as a direct result of the time they have invested to learn and develop their coding skills with us.

            Whatever investment you choose, your logo will appear on the codebar website along with a link to your site. You are also welcome to give a 5 minute talk at the beginning of an evening workshop you host on a topic you think our students will find interesting and informative.
